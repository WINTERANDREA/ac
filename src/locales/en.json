    "bio1": "I got to the <strong>University of Gastronomic Sciences</strong> thanks to a scholarship. There my passion for food was born and, almost as a counterpoint, for <strong>technology</strong> applied to the sector. I finished with an <strong>internship at Argotec</strong> and a <strong>thesis on astronaut meal production</strong>: an experience that taught me method and attention to detail.",
    "bio2": "After a period between <strong>cheese production</strong> and <strong>food safety consulting</strong>, I realized I was looking for a different way to create value. In 2017 I left my comfort zone and went to <strong>Scotland</strong> to improve my English and change perspective. There I met people who had trained themselves: a light bulb went on.",
    "bio3": "I chose <strong>Bangalore</strong> (India) for three intensive months: spartan life, many questions, and the first serious steps in <strong>web and mobile development</strong>. Since then, between online courses, real projects and nights of trying, failing and redoing, I have continued to grow steadily.",
    "bio4": "Today I work as a <strong>freelancer</strong>. My goal is to help people, companies and teams <strong>transform ideas into products</strong>, with care for performance, accessibility and results. Over time I have enriched my profile with experiences in <strong>AI</strong> and a solid foundation in <strong>blockchain</strong> (ConsenSys Academy, 2021), in addition to certifications and recognitions in my first world, that of food.",
    "bio5": "For the year ahead, I've decided to make my time accessible to everyone: whether you're <strong>curious to get your hands dirty with technology</strong>, have <strong>an idea to transform into digital reality</strong>, or represent <strong>a company looking for the right technical partner</strong>. I've created a simple system: my time is <em>bookable by quota</em>. Choose the percentage you need, see <strong>hours</strong> and <strong>investment</strong> instantly, and let's get started.",
